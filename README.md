# Smart Treatment Calendar iOS

Installation Guide:

In order to run this application, you need to first make sure that your laptop is set up properly:
Have-
  Any Apple machine
Install-  
  XCode 11
  Swift 4

Once you have what you need to download the application files, you need to download the local dependencies and pods as this application uses CocoaPods

In terminal, direct to the project files and type "pod install." The podfile contains all the dependencies you need and this should take care of anything you would need to download. 

Once you have everything installed, open up the project files and located "Appt.wkspce." NOTE- this application will not work if you simply press on the project and open it in XCode- you need to press on the workspace. Once those files open up, select the iOS type you want to run the app on and press "Run". A simulator with the application should pop up.
